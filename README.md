# Rugments

This is a very early experiment in porting highlighting lexers from
[Pygments](https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/pygments-main) to Rust.

The final goal might be a shared meta-language to define the highlighters,
with implementations in both languages, or even a Rust core library
with Python binding and extensions.
